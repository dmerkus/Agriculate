Macros for setting up custom matches for practicing AI skill shots in Star Wars: Squadrons.

## How To

### Installation

1. Install the latest version of [AutoHotkey](https://www.autohotkey.com/)

### Initial Setup

1. Set up a Custom Match with your desired settings (Fleet Battles, Private, etc)
2. Make sure the map is set to *Random*
3. Save this Custom Match as the first Preset that will appear on the *Load Presets* screen

### Usage for Practice

1. Start the script (double click with AutoHotkey installed). The GUI with faction/map select should appear
2. Select the map and faction that you want to practice with. The GUI can now be closed. (Bring it up later with `ctrl+shift+a`.)
3. Open Star Wars: Squadrons. On the main menu, have the *Quick Match* button selected (this is the default).
4. Press `ctrl+shift+s` to load up a custom match with your preset. Everything from selecting the custom match to readying up should happen automatically, up until you're launched from the hangar.
5. Repeat this process, selecting different presets for different maps (`ctrl-shift-a` for bringing up the preset GUI).
